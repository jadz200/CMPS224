Consider the reduction operation you are asked to implement in this assignment.
Assume a thread block has 1024 threads and reduces 2048 input elements.

(1) How many steps does a single thread block need to reduce its elements?
=log(2*BlockDim.x)
=log(2*1024)
=log(2048)
=11


(2) How many of these steps exhibit control divergence?
=log(32) #32 number of warps in a block
=5
