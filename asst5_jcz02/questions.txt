The kernels in this assignment with the default parameters set perform a
histogram operation on an image with dimensions 4096x4096 to produce a
histogram with 256 bins. Assume the kernels are configured with 1024 threads
per block. What is the maximum number of atomic operations that may be
performed on global memory for each of the following kernels?

(1) The unoptimized kernel with no privatization in shared memory or thread
    coarsening.
    Each thread is doing one atomic operation.
    Each thread is responsible of one pixel
    4096*4096=16777216
    

(2) The kernel with privatization in shared memory but without thread
    coarsening.
    Each thread is doing at least 1 atomic operation.
    We are doing 1 atomic operation for each BIN in the end since we have NUM_BIN tiles.
    num Blocks * bins = (width * height / numthreadsPerBlock) * bins = 4194304
    4096*4096+256=16777472

(3) The kernel with both privatization in shared memory and thread coarsening
    with a coarsening factor of 64.
    Each thread is doing at least 1 atomic operation.
    We are doing 1 atomic operation for each BIN in the end since we have NUM_BIN tiles.
    Since we are doing thread coarsening by 64, 1 thread is now doing the work of 64 threads.
    4096*4096/64+256=262400
