(1) Assume that a block/tile dimension of 32x32 is used. What is the ratio of
    floating point operations to bytes loaded from global memory performed by
    each of the following kernels? Show your work.

    (a) The kernel implemented in the previous assignment (without shared memory
        tiling)
	2 FP : 2 operations(1 for addition and 1 for multiplication)
	8B: loading 2 floats each one of 4 Bytes
	2 FP / 8B= 0.25 FP/B

    (b) The kernel implemented in this assignment (with shared memory tiling)	
	8B: loading 2 floats each one of 4 Bytes
	64FP : 2 operations(1 for addition and 1 for multiplication)*32(TILE_DIM)
	64 FP/8 B =8FP/B

(2) Assume that a block/tile size of 32x32 is used, and that the program runs
    on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU (the model on the HPC cluster) which has the
    following resource constraints:
        > 2048 max threads/SM
        > 32 max blocks/SM
        > 96KB max shared-memory/SM
        > 64K max registers/SM
    Note that you can extract the resource usage of your kernel, including
    registers/thread and shared-memory/block using the folloing command:
                nvcc -c --ptxas-options="-v" kernel.cu
    Answer the following questions about occupancy for the kernel implemented
    in this assignment. Show your work.

    (a) Is occupancy limited by the max blocks/SM?
	we are using 32*32 threads in each block which is 1024threads/Block
	the max threads per SM is 2048 so we can only have 2 blocks each one of 1024 threads
	So the occupancy is not limited by the max blocks/SM

    (b) Is occupancy limited by the max shared-memory/SM?
	Each shared memory is using 8192 bytes. We are using 2 shared memories so we are using a total of 16384B/SM which is way less than the  max occupancy whch is 96000


    (c) Is occupancy limited by the max registers/SM?
	We are using 26 registers which is way smaller than the  max register 64000 so its not limiting max occupancy
